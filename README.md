# Data-Analysis-With-Python-Projects
This project is an analysis of global renewable energy trends from 1965 to 2022, based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset provides comprehensive information on renewable energy production, consumption, and other related metrics across various countries over the years.
The motivation behind this project is to gain insights into the growth and development of renewable energy sources worldwide. By exploring historical data on solar, hydro, wind, and other renewable energy types, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and factors that have contributed to the evolution of renewable energy adoption over time.
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The dataset contains multiple dimensions of renewable energy data, such as production capacity, consumption, investment, and more, spanning almost six decades.
Methodology.The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and potentially some machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from the dataset. We plan to use Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
**Key Findings:**
# It shown that India's Electricity generation is mainly from non-renewable sources like fossil fuels, coal etc.As renewable sources constitutes only 20-25% of total electricity in India
# Oceania is performing the best in terms of getting electricity generated from Solar Energy.Reason can be that, Oceania is generally hot and humid year-round. While Africs is performing worst , reason can be because of getting highest precipitation thus low solar energy.
# Europe is performing the best in case of Wind energy. Since the 1980s, wind energy has become increasingly important in Europe's power production. From the first wind farms being built in the late 20th century, wind power now provided 17 per cent of Europe's total electricity consumption in 2022. Africa again at bottom.
# Almost half of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)'s electricity comes from hydropower, Reason can be its unique geography and meteorology explain the widespread use of hydropower. Its four largest drainage systems cover about two-thirds of the continent. Most river basins are located east of the Andes and flow towards the Atlantic Ocean. It also has numerous glaciers that feed hydro plants.
# Africa being less active in Renewable source of energy can be because its majority around 60% countries falls in low income countries. Out of 27 low income countries of the world, 23 lies in Africa only. so due to low income Renewable energy is far back for Africa.
**Key Facts:**
Total Solar Energy Generation by High Income Countries is 2728.
Total Wind Energy Generation by High Income Countries is 8127.
Total Hydro Energy Generation by High Income Countries is 65436.
Total Solar Energy Generation by Lower Middle Income Countries is 352.
Total Wind Energy Generation by Lower Middle Income Countries is 675.
Total Hydro Energy Generation by Lower Middle Income Countries is 7745.
This May Indicate that Income of the countries plays an important parameter whether the country will adopt renewable energy source or non-renewable energy source.
